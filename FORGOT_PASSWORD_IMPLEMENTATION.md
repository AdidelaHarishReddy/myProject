# Forgot Password Implementation Summary

## Overview
I have successfully implemented a complete forgot password functionality for the property management application. The implementation includes both backend API endpoints and frontend UI components.

## Backend Implementation

### 1. New Serializers (`backend/core/serializers.py`)
- **ForgotPasswordSerializer**: Validates phone number for password reset request
- **ResetPasswordSerializer**: Validates phone, OTP, and new password for password reset

### 2. New API Views (`backend/core/views.py`)
- **ForgotPasswordView**: 
  - Accepts phone number
  - Generates OTP for password reset
  - Sends OTP via SMS/email (currently prints to console for development)
  - Validates that user exists and is verified

- **ResetPasswordView**:
  - Accepts phone, OTP, and new password
  - Verifies OTP using existing OTP verification system
  - Sets new password if OTP is valid
  - Returns success/error messages

### 3. URL Configuration (`backend/core/urls.py`)
- Added routes for `/api/auth/forgot-password/` and `/api/auth/reset-password/`

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. Updated Auth API (`frontend/src/api/auth.js`)
- **forgotPassword(phone)**: Calls forgot password endpoint
- **resetPassword(phone, otp, newPassword)**: Calls reset password endpoint

### 2. New ForgotPassword Component (`frontend/src/components/Auth/ForgotPassword.jsx`)
- **Two-step process**:
  - Step 1: Enter phone number to receive OTP
  - Step 2: Enter OTP and new password
- **Features**:
  - Password strength validation (minimum 8 characters)
  - Password confirmation matching
  - Show/hide password toggles
  - Resend OTP functionality
  - Error and success message handling
  - Automatic redirect to login after successful reset

### 3. Updated Login Component (`frontend/src/components/Auth/Login.jsx`)
- Changed forgot password link to use React Router navigation
- Properly imports RouterLink for navigation

### 4. Updated App.js (`frontend/src/App.js`)
- Added ForgotPassword component import
- Added `/forgot-password` route

## Security Features

1. **OTP Verification**: Uses existing OTP system for secure password reset
2. **Account Verification**: Only verified accounts can reset passwords
3. **Password Validation**: Minimum 8 character requirement
4. **Password Confirmation**: Ensures user enters password correctly
5. **Token-based Authentication**: Maintains security standards

## User Flow

1. User clicks "Forgot password?" on login page
2. User enters phone number
3. System sends OTP to user's phone
4. User enters OTP and new password
5. System verifies OTP and updates password
6. User is redirected to login page

## Development Notes

- OTP is currently printed to console for development/testing
- In production, integrate with SMS service (Twilio, etc.) or email service
- All endpoints return proper HTTP status codes and error messages
- Frontend includes comprehensive error handling and user feedback

## Testing

- Created test script (`test_forgot_password.py`) to verify API endpoints
- All components include proper error handling
- Responsive design using Material-UI components

## Files Modified/Created

### Backend:
- `backend/core/serializers.py` - Added new serializers
- `backend/core/views.py` - Added new views
